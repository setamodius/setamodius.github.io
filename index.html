        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>SCADA Software Development</h3>
            <p>Developed a modular and scalable SCADA software platform using WPF technology. Transitioning to Avalonia UI and WebAssembly to enable cross-platform support and web deployment. Implemented a microservices architecture with RabbitMQ for message brokering and Quasar Framework for the front-end. Involved in developing an 8-channel current reading card utilizing the Modbus TCP protocol and Texas Instruments' TM4C1294KCPDT microcontroller.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Intelligent Transportation Systems</h3>
            <p>Integrated MQTT protocol for efficient and secure data transmission in intelligent transportation systems. Focused on low bandwidth usage, publish-subscribe model, and seamless integration with IoT devices and microcontrollers. Enhanced system security through end-to-end encryption and authentication mechanisms. Managed on-site installation and commissioning of SCADA systems for remote construction sites.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Remote Construction Site Automation</h3>
            <p>Implemented automation solutions for remote construction sites, leveraging SCADA systems to monitor and control site operations. Utilized sensors and IoT devices to collect real-time data, enabling predictive maintenance and improved operational efficiency. Developed custom dashboards for data visualization and analysis, and worked on network design including VLAN structures and switch configuration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Dynamic Message Sign (DMS) Management</h3>
            <p>Developed message preparation and management software for various brands of Dynamic Message Signs (DMS). Prepared adapter software to facilitate communication integration between DMS devices and SCADA systems, ensuring seamless data flow and efficient traffic management.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Web-Based SCADA Client</h3>
            <p>Designed a web-based SCADA client using websocket technology, providing flexible usage options. Dockerized the entire software for easier deployment and management, enabling containerized operation with GlusterFS for redundancy. Integrated third-party software support to include various industrial communication protocols such as Modbus, OPC DA, SNMP, and NTCIP.</p>

        <h2>Hobby Projects</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Smart Irrigation System</h3>
            <p>This project is an automated system designed to supply the necessary water for plants. It can be easily programmed via an LCD screen and performs watering automatically when needed based on the moisture level of the soil at predetermined days and times. This system contributes to the healthy growth of plants while conserving water.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Pharmatherm</h3>
            <p>Maintaining the cold chain in pharmacies is of vital importance. Pharmatherm is a product I developed to address this need. It monitors the temperature inside pharmacy refrigerators through sensors and sends SMS alerts to concerned individuals if the temperature exceeds set limits. For this product, I designed hardware that collects data from sensors via Bluetooth technology and transmits it to a cloud-based server. I also integrated a system that saves data to an SD card in case of internet connection failures, ensuring no data loss and transmitting it to the server once the connection is restored.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Home Lighting and Temperature Control System</h3>
            <p>This project aims to make your home smarter and more energy-efficient. It automatically adjusts the home lighting according to the sunset time and controls the heating system (e.g. boiler) based on the indoor temperature. Using ESP32 and SonOff devices, the project provides a simple, effective, and cost-efficient solution for home automation.</p>
